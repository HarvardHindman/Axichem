# Forecast Sheet Plugin Fix

## Issue Overview
The forecast sheet was not properly loading saved products and quantities when the page was refreshed. After analyzing the code, I identified the following issues:

1. The AJAX response format was inconsistent - sometimes the server returned a JSON string and sometimes it returned a direct object.
2. The code to add products to the table was not handling the product data correctly when loading saved products.
3. There was a race condition where quantities were being set before products were fully added to the table.
4. Duplicate event handler initialization was causing unpredictable behavior.

## Solution

I've created fixed versions of the key files:

1. `includes/js/lionandlamb-axichem-fixed.js` - Fixed JavaScript file
2. `forecast-sheets-fixed.php` - Fixed main plugin file

## Implementation Instructions

To implement the fix:

1. Backup your existing files:
   - `forecast-sheets.php`
   - `includes/js/lionandlamb-axichem.js`
   - `includes/js/lionandlamb-axichem-clean.js` (if it exists)

2. Replace `forecast-sheets.php` with `forecast-sheets-fixed.php`:
   ```
   cd c:\xampp\htdocs\Axichem\demosite\wp-content\plugins\forecast-sheets
   copy forecast-sheets.php forecast-sheets.php.bak
   copy forecast-sheets-fixed.php forecast-sheets.php
   ```

3. Replace the JavaScript file:
   ```
   cd c:\xampp\htdocs\Axichem\demosite\wp-content\plugins\forecast-sheets\includes\js
   copy lionandlamb-axichem-clean.js lionandlamb-axichem-clean.js.bak
   copy lionandlamb-axichem-fixed.js lionandlamb-axichem-clean.js
   ```

## Key Changes

1. **Improved Response Handling**: The code now properly handles both string and object response formats.

2. **Asynchronous Product Loading**: Added Promise-based loading to ensure all products are added before updating quantities.

3. **Better Error Handling**: Added more comprehensive error handling and logging to make future debugging easier.

4. **Removed Duplicate Initialization**: Removed duplicate event handlers and function declarations.

5. **Added Debug Logging**: Added detailed console logging to help troubleshoot any future issues.

## Testing

After implementing these changes, refresh the forecast sheet page and verify:

1. All previously saved products appear in the table
2. The quantities are correctly loaded for each product
3. The row totals are correctly calculated
4. The year selection dropdown works properly
5. You can add and remove products as expected
6. Saving the form works correctly

## Further Improvements (Optional)

For future enhancement, consider:

1. Using more robust error handling with user-friendly messages
2. Adding a loading animation during AJAX operations
3. Implementing data caching to reduce server load
4. Adding a confirmation dialog before removing products
5. Implementing auto-save functionality
